I am a Ph.D. student affiliated with [Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG)](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/) at [University of Trento, Italy](https://www.unitn.it/en), advised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=stFCYOAAAAAJ&hl=en).
My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and differential geometry, such as geometric deep learning and matrix/vector manifolds. 
Before my Ph.D. studies, I received a B.A. degree in logistics management from Shandong University, Jinan, China, and an M.S. degree in computer science and technology from Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiao-Jun Wu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5IST34sAAAAJ&hl=en). 

Currently, I co-supervise several students with [Rui Wang](https://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1081/2941.htm).

I am building a GitHub repo, [DeepRiemannNet](https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/Awesome-Riemannian-Deep-Learning), focused on deep learning over Riemannian spaces. ðŸš€
