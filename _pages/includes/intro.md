I am a Ph.D. student affiliated with [Multimedia and Human Understanding Group (MHUG)](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/) at [University of Trento, Italy](https://www.unitn.it/en), advised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=stFCYOAAAAAJ&hl=en). 
Before my Ph.D. studies, I received a B.A. degree in logistics management from Shandong University, Jinan, China, and an M.S. degree in computer science and technology from Jiangnan University, Wuxi, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Xiao-Jun Wu](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5IST34sAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Josef Kittler](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/josef-kittler). 

My research lies in the intersection of machine learning and differential geometry, such as geometric deep learning. 
I am coorperating with talented students on applying non-Euclidean methods into practical tasks, including vision, biosignal, and multimodality. 
I also co-supervise several students with [Rui Wang](https://ai.jiangnan.edu.cn/info/1081/2941.htm).
I am always open for collaboration. If you are interested in my research, please drop me an email. 

I am building a GitHub repo, [Awesome-Riemannian-Deep-Learning](https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/Awesome-Riemannian-Deep-Learning), containing resources on deep learning over Riemannian spaces. ðŸš€
