- Identification of the underlying product structure in the existing Cholesky metric.
- Introduction of two novel Riemannian metrics on the Cholesky manifold, along with a comprehensive analysis of their geometric properties.
- Proposal of two numerically stable Riemannian metrics on the SPD manifold, with a detailed analysis of their geometric properties.
